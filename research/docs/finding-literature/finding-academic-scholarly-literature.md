# Finding Academic Scholarly Literature

> ❗Papers published in **peer reviewed** journals/conferences are much more likely to be accurate than blogs or other non reviewed sources.



**`DOI`**`: Digital Object Identifier`; a unique identifier assigned to a specific piece of content, such as a research paper, article, or dataset.&#x20;



Go through these before reading a paper to see whether it's worth reading:

* `title`
* `highlights`
* `abstract`
* `keywords`



If you find a very good recent article, to find more relevant articles,&#x20;

╰**---**➤ you can go for it's `recommended articles` and `references`.



Higher number of citations -> Then better to have a look at it



## Academic Scholarly Literature

* Peer reviewed scholarly publishers/journals
* E Journals
* Intellectual magazines
*   IR: Institutional Repositories



## Predatory Journals & Publishers



### Open Access Journals

Authors pay publishing fees so that the journals can make the full text of articles freely available to everyone. This is great idea if it's done with integrity.

Example of Open Access Publishing Model

* PLOS Journals: Public Library of Science journals



Predatory journals and publishers exploit the academic need to publish by charging fees without offering genuine editorial or publishing services. They often falsely claim peer review and inclusion in reputable databases.&#x20;

### `Beall's List` &#x20;

[Beall's List](https://beallslist.net/), created by Jeffrey Beall, identified potential **predatory open-access publishers** to help researchers avoid disreputable submissions. Despite its removal in 2017, archived versions and similar resources still aid in recognizing predatory journals.
