# Finding Academic Scholarly Literature

**`DOI`**`: Digital Object Identifier`; a unique identifier assigned to a specific piece of content, such as a research paper, article, or dataset.&#x20;

## Finding and Organizing Literature

### Finding Literature &#x20;

[`Good Papers`](finding-academic-scholarly-literature.md#academic-scholarly-literature) | [`Bad Papers`](finding-academic-scholarly-literature.md#predatory-journals-and-publishers)

* use most effective method to find relevant work
* use **research specific search engines**
  * GoogleScholar, dblb, Research Gate

{% hint style="success" %}
Broaden the definition of relevant work when doing the literature review.
{% endhint %}

* look for
  * _**`survey papers`**_: classify, summarize, compare, critically evaluate  existing work
    * good survey papers reference close to 100 good papers
    * they have already done part of your work
  * _**`benchmark papers`**_: introduce benchmarks that can be used to analyse algorithms or methods of doing things&#x20;
    * introduce groundbreaking methodologies, theories, or experimental results that challenge existing paradigms and shape future research directions
  * _**`vision papers`**_: pioneers in a certain domain publish these describing what they  wish to achieve

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's hard to find all relevant work.&#x20;

Focus on finding **all significant work** relevant to your research.
{% endhint %}

### Organizing Literature

{% hint style="success" %}
Searching for papers and reading them should be separate tasks.
{% endhint %}

* Gather reading material first
  * use tools as much as possible
    * e.g: reference management software&#x20;
* Organize the literature you've gathered
* Read and analye literature later

### Reading Literature

#### Before Reading a Paper

Go through these before reading a paper to see whether it's worth reading:

* `title`
* `highlights`
* `abstract`
* `keywords`



## ‚úÖ Academic Scholarly Literature

* Peer reviewed scholarly publishers/journals
* E Journals
* Intellectual magazines
* IR: Institutional Repositories

{% hint style="success" %}
‚ùóPapers published in **peer reviewed journals/conferences** are much more likely to be accurate than blogs or other non reviewed sources.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If a paper is **indexed** in a reputed Index such as **Corpus** index or **IEEEXstream**, then it's likely to be a good paper. But not always.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Check the **impact of the conference** where the paper is published.

* Impact Factor
* H-Index
* Average Citations

‚Äî higher numbers represents better work&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Higher number of citations** -> Then better to have a look at it
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Rely on accepted **ranking mechanisms/lists**.

If you find a very good recent article, to find more relevant articles,&#x20;

## üö´ Predatory Journals & Publishers

Predatory open-access journals exploit the open-access model for profit by charging publication fees without proper peer review or editorial services. They deceive authors with false claims of quality and inclusion in reputable databases.

üìçüó∫Ô∏è **India** is the world's largest base for bogus fee-charging open-access publishing. The next largest base is the **United States**. In Africa, **Nigeria** has the largest number.

\#Ô∏è‚É£‚¨ÜÔ∏è Number of predatory journals is increasing.



### Open Access Journals

Authors pay fees to make articles freely accessible, which is valuable when done ethically.&#x20;

However, this model has led to the rise of bogus journals that prioritize profit over publishing quality research.



Example of Open Access Publishing Model:

* `PLOS` Journals: Public Library of Science Journals

### `Beall's List` &#x20;

[`https://beallslist.net`](https://beallslist.net/)

[Beall's List](https://beallslist.net/), created by librarian _**Jeffrey Beall,**_ identified **predatory publishers** to help researchers avoid them.&#x20;

Though removed in 2017, archived versions remain useful.&#x20;

Journalist John Bohannon revealed the extent of predatory practices by submitting a flawed paper to 255 journals; 157 accepted it, including 82% of those on Beall's List.



### Declan `Butler's Checklist` for Avoiding Predatory Journals

This checklist was published in the journal "Nature" in 2013 in an article titled "Investigating Journals: The Dark Side of Publishing" by D. Butler.



1. Check that the publisher provides full, `verifiable contact information, including address`, on the journal site. Be cautious of those that provide only web contact forms.
2. Check that a journal's **editorial board** lists `recognised experts with full affiliations`. `Contact` some of them and ask about their experience with the journal or publisher.
3. Check that the journal prominently displays its `policy for author fees`.
4. Be wary of `e-mail invitations` to submit to journals or to become editorial board members.
5. Read some of the journal's `published articles` and `assess their quality`. `Contact past authors` to ask about their experience.
6. Check that a journal's **peer-review process** is clearly described and try to confirm that a `claimed impact factor is correct`.
   * Popular bogus metrics made by predatory journals&#x20;
     * UIF: Universal Impact Factor
     * GIF: Global Impact Factor
     * JIF: Journal Impact Factor
7. Find out whether the journal is a `member of` an industry association that vets its members, such as the **Directory of Open Access Journals** (www.doaj.org) or the **Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association** (www.oaspa.org).
8. Use `common sense`, as you would when shopping online: if something looks fishy, proceed with caution.



### `DOAJ`: Directory of Open Access Journals

[`www.doaj.org`](https://www.doaj.org)

The **Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)** is a community-curated database that indexes high-quality, peer-reviewed open access journals, ensuring they meet established standards for credibility and reliability in publishing.



### `OASPA`: Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association

[`www.oaspa.org`](https://www.oaspa.org)

The **Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA)** is a membership organization promoting best practices in open access publishing, ensuring transparency and integrity among professional publishers.
