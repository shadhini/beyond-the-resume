# Finding Academic Scholarly Literature

> ‚ùóPapers published in **peer reviewed** journals/conferences are much more likely to be accurate than blogs or other non reviewed sources.



**`DOI`**`: Digital Object Identifier`; a unique identifier assigned to a specific piece of content, such as a research paper, article, or dataset.&#x20;



Go through these before reading a paper to see whether it's worth reading:

* `title`
* `highlights`
* `abstract`
* `keywords`



If you find a very good recent article, to find more relevant articles,&#x20;

‚ï∞**---**‚û§ you can go for it's `recommended articles` and `references`.



Higher number of citations -> Then better to have a look at it



## Academic Scholarly Literature

* Peer reviewed scholarly publishers/journals
* E Journals
* Intellectual magazines
*   IR: Institutional Repositories



## Predatory Journals & Publishers

Predatory open-access journals are bogus journals that exploit the open-access model for financial gain. They publish any submitted content, regardless of quality, without undergoing a rigorous peer-review process.&#x20;

By charging authors publication fees, these journals capitalise on the academic need to publish while providing little or no genuine editorial or publishing services. They often deceive authors by falsely claiming peer review and inclusion in reputable databases.



üìçüó∫Ô∏è **India** is the world's largest base for bogus fee-charging open-access publishing. The next largest base is the **United States**. In Africa, **Nigeria** has the largest number.

\#Ô∏è‚É£‚¨ÜÔ∏è Number of predatory journals is increasing.



### Open Access Journals

Authors pay publishing fees so that the journals can make the full text of articles freely available to everyone. This is great idea if it's done with integrity.

Since, money is exchanging hands, this has opened the floodgates for the creation of bogus journals which exist solely to collect money from authors, not to publish high-quality research.



Example of Open Access Publishing Model:

* `PLOS` Journals: Public Library of Science Journals

### `Beall's List` &#x20;

[`https://beallslist.net`](https://beallslist.net/)

[Beall's List](https://beallslist.net/), created by _Jeffrey Beall_, a librarian at the University of Colorado, Denver, identified potential **predatory open-access publishers** to help researchers avoid disreputable submissions. Despite its removal in 2017, archived versions and similar resources still aid in recognizing predatory journals.

The journalist, _John Bohannon_ submitted an obviously flawed, bogus slightly different versions of cancer paper to 255 open-access journals; the paper was accepted to 157 journals and rejected by only 98. 82% of the publishers on Beall's list accepted the paper.



### Declan `Butler's Checklist` for Avoiding Predatory Journals

This checklist was published in the journal "Nature" in 2013 in an article titled "Investigating Journals: The Dark Side of Publishing" by D. Butler.



1. Check that the publisher provides full, `verifiable contact information, including address`, on the journal site. Be cautious of those that provide only web contact forms.
2. Check that a journal's **editorial board** lists `recognised experts with full affiliations`. `Contact` some of them and ask about their experience with the journal or publisher.
3. Check that the journal prominently displays its `policy for author fees`.
4. Be wary of `e-mail invitations` to submit to journals or to become editorial board members.
5. Read some of the journal's `published articles` and `assess their quality`. `Contact past authors` to ask about their experience.
6. Check that a journal's **peer-review process** is clearly described and try to confirm that a `claimed impact factor is correct`.
   * Popular bogus metrics made by predatory journals&#x20;
     * UIF: Universal Impact Factor
     * GIF: Global Impact Factor
     * JIF: Journal Impact Factor
7. Find out whether the journal is a `member of` an industry association that vets its members, such as the **Directory of Open Access Journals** (www.doaj.org) or the **Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association** (www.oaspa.org).
8. Use `common sense`, as you would when shopping online: if something looks fishy, proceed with caution.



### `DOAJ`: Directory of Open Access Journals

[`www.doaj.org`](https://www.doaj.org)

The **Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)** is a community-curated database that indexes high-quality, peer-reviewed open access journals, ensuring they meet established standards for credibility and reliability in publishing.



### `OASPA`: Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association

[`www.oaspa.org`](https://www.oaspa.org)
