# Welcome to My Research Journey !

Embark with me on a deep dive into the world of research in computer science and software engineering! This blog is dedicated to breaking down aspects of the research process—from understanding how to conduct meaningful research, reading and analyzing research papers effectively, to performing thorough evaluations and much more. Whether you're just starting your research journey or looking to refine your skills, this space aims to guide you through your journey, sharing insights and strategies to make the process both accessible and impactful.

Let’s navigate the path of discovery together, one research step at a time!

## How to Conduct a Research?

1. Identify research papers relevant[^1] to a topic from credible sources&#x20;
2. Synthesize the literature
3. Formulate the research problem&#x20;
   * should find a **research gap** based on the literature review &#x20;
4. Prepare the project proposal
5. Design the methodology and the evaluation of the research
6. Write the thesis/research paper&#x20;
   * good writing&#x20;
   * use research tools
   * adhere to correct referencing practices

{% hint style="success" %}
Follow an **ethical procedure** when conducting research.
