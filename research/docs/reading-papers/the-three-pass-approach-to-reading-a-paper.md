# The Three-Pass Approach to Reading a Paper

> 1st pass   ->&#x20;
>
> 2nd pass ->
>
> 3rd pass  ->

### First Pass

1. Carefully read the&#x20;
2.
   1. title,&#x20;
   2. abstract and&#x20;
   3. the introduction
3. Read the section and subsection headings but, ignore the rest.
4. Read the conclusions.
5. Glance over the references.
6.
   1. mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read

\


Goal: get an overview of the paper. I.e.,

* Category: What type of paper is it?  A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
* Context: Which other papers is it related to and what theoretical basis was used to address the problem?&#x20;
* Correctness: Are the assumptions reasonable?&#x20;
* Contributions: What are the main contributions of the paper?
* Clarity: Is the paper written clearly?

\


**After the 1st pass,**&#x20;

* you can decide whether or not to do another pass through the paper.

\


**Some reasons why you may decide not to continue reading the paper include,**

* The paper is of no interest to you.
* You don't have the necessary background to understand the paper.
* Authors have made invalid assumptions.

\


### Second Pass

This time you read the paper more carefully. But still, ignore fine

details such as proofs.

\


Pay careful attention to&#x20;

* figures, diagrams, graphs and other illustrations.
*
  * Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

\


As you read on,&#x20;

* write down key points or&#x20;
* make comments in the margins.

\


Mark relevant references you've not read before for future reading.

\


This pass will take more time (about an hour).

\


**After the second pass,**

* Hopefully, you would be able to summarize the main contributions of the paper with supporting evidence.

\


At times, you may not grasp the contents of the paper even after the second pass.

Some reasons include,

* You are new to the subject matter or may be unfamiliar with some of the techniques/ theories used.
* The paper is poorly written.
* You are just having a bad day or just tired.
* If you don't grasp the paper, you can return to the paper later and perhaps read some background material, just leave it aside, or continue to the third pass anyway.

\


### Third Pass

Objective: fully understand the paper, to a level where you can literally re-implement the work presented in the paper.

* Requires very careful attention to detail
* Can take up to five hours or more if you are not an expert in the particular area.&#x20;

## Doing a Literature Survey

**What papers should you read?**&#x20;

**First Pass**

Step 1:

* use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find 3 to 5 recent papers in the area.&#x20;
* Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections.&#x20;
*
  * You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper.&#x20;

Step 2:

* If you can find such a survey, you are done.
*
  * Read the survey,&#x20;
* Otherwise, in the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography.&#x20;
*
  * These are the key papers and researchers in that area.&#x20;
  * Download the key papers and set them aside.&#x20;
  * Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they’ve published recently.
  * That will help you identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.

Step 3:

* The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings.&#x20;
* A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work.
* These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey.&#x20;

\


**Second Pass**

Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.

\


## Paper Review

a short essay (5 pages, single-space) reporting what you have learned from reading a research paper

\


### 1. Summary

* brief summary of the work in your own words (MUST)
*
  * If you don’t write it with your own words, then it is plagiarism
* This section should answer the 4 questions of understanding the paper
*
  * **What research problem is the paper attempting to solve?**
  *
    * What crisis, weakness with existing work in the field is the paper trying to address?
  * **What contributions do the authors claim they make?**
  *
    * What's new in the paper?
    * A new algorithm, new evidence to prove/disprove a previously made claim? Etc.
  * **How do the authors support their claims?**
  *
    * What methodology, experiments, analyses, simulations etc. are used to confirm their claims?
  * **What are the conclusions of the paper?**
  *
    * What can one learn from the paper?
* The summary should be structured as follows:&#x20;

1. motivation
2. Contribution
3. Methodology and/or argument and&#x20;
4. Conclusion

\


### 2. Critique

Pick two to three points you want to argue with the authors

\


* Use the questions to evaluate the paper
*
  * **Is the research problem significant?**
  *
    * Does the problem really exist and is it important? Or
    * Are they making up a nonexistent problem or solving a minor problem?
  * **Are the contributions significant?**
  *
    * Does the paper contribute enough to the existing body of knowledge, is the paper worth reading? Or
    * Are they just repeating existing work?
  * **Are the claims valid?**
  *
    * Are theorems correctly proven, experiments properly setup, generalization valid,? Is the data used appropriate? etc.

\


* Do not repeat the Limitations section of the paper.&#x20;
* Pick points of disagreement, and launch an intellectual debate with the authors.&#x20;
* Carefully articulate and substantiate your case.&#x20;
* Do not just say, “I don’t like this point.” Instead, give technical reasons to substantiate your critiques.
* Be specific in your choice of words. Avoid generic adjectives such as “bad”, “poor”, “lame”, “stupid”, etc, and their synonyms and antonyms. You can go a lot further by replacing such vague words with more specific ones: “inelegant”, “inefficient”, “memory-intensive”, “ill-defined”, etc.

\


### 3. Synthesis

* Propose one to two ways in which the research work can be further developed.&#x20;
* Do not repeat the Future Work section of the paper.&#x20;
* Be original.&#x20;
* Consult the following  list of questions, if you run out of ideas.
*
  * What is the crux of the research problem?
  * What are some alternative approaches to address the research problem?
  * Is there an alternative way to substantiate the claim of the authors?
  * What is a good argument against the case made by the authors?
  * Can the research results be strengthened?
  * Can the research results be applied to another context?
  * What are the open problems raised by this work?
  * Bottom line: If you were to do the research, how would you do differently?
