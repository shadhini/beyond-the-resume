# Second Pass

> Lets you grasp the paper's content, but not its details.
>
>
>
> This time you read the paper more `carefully`. But still, **ignore fine details such as proofs**.



❗Pay careful attention to

*   **figures**, **diagrams**, **graphs** and other **illustrations**.

    * Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.



✅ As you read on,

* **write down key points** or
* make **comments** in the margins.



✅ **Mark relevant references** you've not read before **for future reading**.



🕙 This pass will take more time (about an hour).



## After the second pass,

* Hopefully, you would be able to **summarise the main contributions (`main thrust`)** of the paper with supporting evidence.

#### At times, you may not grasp the contents of the paper even after the second pass.

Some reasons include,

* You are new to the subject matter or may be unfamiliar with some of the techniques/ theories used.
* The paper is poorly written.
* You are just having a bad day or just tired.

#### If you don't grasp the paper,&#x20;

* you can return to the paper later and perhaps read some background material
* OR you can just leave it aside
* OR continue to the third pass anyway
