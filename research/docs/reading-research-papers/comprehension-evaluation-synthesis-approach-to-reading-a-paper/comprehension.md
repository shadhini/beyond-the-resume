# Comprehension

> **Understand what's in the paper to summarise**



You should ask yourself the following 4 questions when reading a research paper.

1.  What **`research problem`** is the paper attempting to solve?

    * `motivation`?
    * a `crisis` paper attempts to resolve in the research field?&#x20;
    * `weaknesses` of existing `approaches` that paper attempting to overcome ?&#x20;
    * challenged existing `research paradigm` ?&#x20;
    * the `niche` of the paper?


2. What **`contributions`** do the authors claim they make?
   *   What is **new** in this paper?

       * new _`question`_
       * new _`understanding`_ of the research problem
       * new _`methodology`_ for solving problems
       * new _`algorithm`_
       * new breed of software _`tools`_ or _`systems`_
       * new _`experimental method`_
       * new _`proof technique`_
       * new _`formalism`_ or _`notation`_
       * new _`evidence`_ to substantiate or disprove a previously published claim
       * new _`research area`_


3. How do the authors **`substantiate/support`** their **`claims`**?&#x20;
   * what makes the claims scientific (as opposed to being mere opinions)
   * the `methodology` adopted to substantiate the claims
   * the `argument` of the paper
   * the `major theorems`
   * `experiments` conducted
   * `data analyses`
   * `simulations`
   * `bench-marks`
   * `user studies`
   * `case studies`
   *   `examples`&#x20;


4. What are the **`conclusions`** of the paper?&#x20;
   * What can one **learn** from the paper?
     * Shall the `standard practice` of the field be `changed` as a result of the new findings?
     * Is the `result generalisable`?&#x20;
     * Can the `result` be `applied to other area`s of the field?&#x20;
     * What are the `open problems`?&#x20;



❗ The _**`abstract`**_ of a paper; which is a summary of the paper should outline the answers to above questions.



✅ Every good paper tells a **`story`**. So when you read a paper, ask yourself, “`What is the plot?`”&#x20;

* A good research paper follows a storyline with a clear structure, answering four main questions above.
