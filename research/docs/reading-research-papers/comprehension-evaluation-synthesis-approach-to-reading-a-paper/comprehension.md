What **`contributions`** do the authors claim they make?

* What's `new` in the paper?
* A new algorithm, new evidence to prove/disprove a previously made claim? Etc.

How do the authors **`support`** their **`claims`**?

* What `methodology`, `experiments`, `analyses`, `simulations` etc. are used to confirm their claims?

What are the **`conclusions`** of the paper?

You should ask yourself the following 4 questions when reading a research paper.

* What is the **`research problem`** the paper attempts to address?&#x20;
  * `motivation`?
  * a `crisis` paper attempts to resolve in the research field?&#x20;
  * `weaknesses` of existing `approaches` that paper attempting to overcome ?&#x20;
  * challenged existing `research paradigm` ?&#x20;
  * the `niche` of the paper?
* What are the **`claimed contributions`** of the paper?&#x20;
  * What is **new** in this paper?
    * new _`question`_
    * new _`understanding`_ of the research problem
    * new _`methodology`_ for solving problems
    * new _`algorithm`_
    * new breed of software _`tools`_ or _`systems`_
    * new _`experimental method`_
    * new _`proof technique`_
    * new _`formalism`_ or _`notation`_
    * new _`evidence`_ to substantiate or disprove a previously published claim
    * new _`research area`_
  * what is **innovative** about this paper?
*   How do the authors **substantiate** their **claims**? What is the methodology adopted

    to substantiate the claims? What is the argument of the paper? What are the major

    theorems? What experiments are conducted? Data analyses? Simulations? Bench-

    marks? User studies? Case studies? Examples? In short, what makes the claims

    scientific (as opposed to being mere opinions1)?

    4\. What are the conclusions? What have we learned from the paper? Shall the

    standard practice of the field be changed as a result of the new findings? Is the result

    generalizable? Can the result be applied to other areas of the field? What are the open

    problems? In short, what are the lessons one can learn from the paper?
