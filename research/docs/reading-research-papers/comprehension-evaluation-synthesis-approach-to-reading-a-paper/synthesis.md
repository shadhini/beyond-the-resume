> It can inspire fresh directions and questions to explore.

**Bottom line**: `If you were to do the research, how would you do differently?`

* What is the `crux` of the `research problem`?
* What are some `alternative approaches` to address the research problem?
* Can the `arguments/claims` be `supported` in `other ways`?
* What is a `good argument` against the case made by the authors?
* Can the `research results be strengthened`?
* Can the `results be applied to other context`s/applications?
* What are the `open problems raised` by this work?
