# Evaluation

> **Evaluating the paper**
>
> ╰**---**➤ careful validation of scientific claims

1. Is the **`research problem significant`**?
   * Does the problem really `exist` and is it `important`?&#x20;
     * enable practical applications
     * deepen understanding
     * explore new design space
   *   Are they making up a `nonexistent` problem or solving a `minor problem`?


2.  Are the **`contributions significant`**?

    * Does the paper contribute enough to the existing body of knowledge, is the paper `worth reading`?&#x20;
    * Are they just `repeating` existing work?
    * Are the authors aware of the `relation` of their work `to existing literature`?&#x20;
    * Is the paper addressing a well-known `open problem`?


3. Are the **`claims valid`**?
   * theorems correctly proven
   * errors in proofs
   * experiments properly setup
   * confounding factors
   * unrealistic, artificial benchmarks
   * comparing apples and oranges
   * methodological misunderstanding
   * do the numbers add up?&#x20;
   * generalisation valid
   * claims modest enough
   * is the data used appropriate?
