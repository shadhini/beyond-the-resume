# First Pass

## Step 1:

* use an academic search engine such as `Google Scholar` or `CiteSeer` and some **well-chosen keywords** to find 3 to 5 recent papers in the area.
* Do **one pass** on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their **related work** sections.
  * You will find a thumbnail summary of the **recent work**, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent **survey** paper.

## Step 2:

* If you can find such a **survey**, you are done.
  * Read the survey,
* Otherwise, in the second step, find **shared citations** and **repeated author names** in the bibliography.
  * These are the **key papers and researchers** in that area.
  * Download the key papers and set them aside.
  * Then go to the **websites of the key researchers** and see where theyâ€™ve published recently.
  * That will help you identify the **top conferences** in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.

## Step 3:

* The third step is to go to the **website for** these **top conferences** and look through their recent proceedings.
* A quick scan will usually identify **recent high-quality related work**.
* These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey.
