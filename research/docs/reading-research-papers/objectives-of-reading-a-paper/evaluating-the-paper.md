# Evaluating the Paper

Is the **`research problem significant`**?

* Does the problem really exist and is it important? Or
* Are they making up a nonexistent problem or solving a minor problem?

Are the **`contributions significant`**?

* Does the paper contribute enough to the existing body of knowledge, is the paper worth reading? Or
* Are they just repeating existing work?

Are the **`claims valid`**?

* Are theorems correctly proven, experiments properly setup, generalisation valid,? Is the data used appropriate? etc.
