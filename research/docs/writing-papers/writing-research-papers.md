# Writing Research Papers

✅ A good research paper follows a **`storyline`** with a clear structure, answering four main questions mentioned in [Comprehension](../reading-research-papers/comprehension-evaluation-synthesis-approach-to-reading-a-paper/comprehension.md) section.



❗Most reviewers/readers make only `one pass` over a research paper.&#x20;

If a reviewer/reader cannot understand the `gist`/ the `highlights` of the paper, after one pass or after five minutes,&#x20;

╰**---**➤ The paper will likely never be read.

Thus,

* ✅ Choose **coherent section & subsection `titles`**.
* ✅ Write **concise** and **comprehensive** **`abstracts`**.



## Abstract

> A **`summary`** of the paper&#x20;
>
> &#x20; that outline the answers to questions mentioned in [**Comprehension**](../reading-research-papers/comprehension-evaluation-synthesis-approach-to-reading-a-paper/comprehension.md) section.
