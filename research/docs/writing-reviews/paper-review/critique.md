# Critique

> Pick **two to three points** you want to argue with the authors

Use the questions to evaluate the paper

* Is the **research problem significant**?
  * Does the problem really exist and is it important? Or
  * Are they making up a nonexistent problem or solving a minor problem?
* Are the **contributions significant**?
  * Does the paper contribute enough to the existing body of knowledge, is the paper worth reading? Or
  * Are they just repeating existing work?
*   Are the **claims valid**?

    * Are theorems correctly proven, experiments properly setup, generalization valid,? Is the data used appropriate? etc.


* Do **not repeat** the **Limitations** section of the paper.
* Pick **points of disagreement**, and launch an **intellectual debate** with the authors.
* Carefully **articulate and substantiate** your case.
* Do not just say, “I don’t like this point.” Instead, **give technical reasons** to substantiate your critiques.
* Be specific in your **choice of words**.&#x20;
  * Avoid generic adjectives such as “bad”, “poor”, “lame”, “stupid”, etc, and their synonyms and antonyms.&#x20;
  * You can go a lot further by replacing such vague words with more specific ones: “inelegant”, “inefficient”, “memory-intensive”, “ill-defined”, etc.
