* Do **not repeat** the **Limitations** section of the paper.
* Pick **points of disagreement**, and launch an **intellectual debate** with the authors.
* Carefully **articulate and substantiate** your case.
  * Do not just say, “I don’t like this point.” Instead, **give technical reasons** to substantiate your critiques.
* Be specific in your **choice of words**.&#x20;
  * Avoid generic adjectives such as “bad”, “poor”, “lame”, “stupid”, etc, and their synonyms and antonyms.&#x20;
  * You can go a lot further by replacing such vague words with more specific ones: “inelegant”, “inefficient”, “memory-intensive”, “ill-defined”, etc.
