# How referees review a paper?

> When a research paper is submitted to a conference or a journal, it will undergo a **peer review process**.

The _referees_ who review the submitted paper&#x20;

* Do a [Summary](summary.md)
* Do a [Critique](critique.md)
* Write up a **referee report** in a style similar to the [sample outline of paper review](a-sample-outline-of-a-paper-review.md).

Based on the _referee reports_, the program chair of a conference or the editor of a journal will then make the decision of whether to accept the paper.&#x20;
