# GitHub Overview Graph Percentages

## General Guideline for GitHub Overview Graph Percentages

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no one-size-fits-all "perfect percentage"!
{% endhint %}

### **1. Pull Requests (PRs): \~30-40%**

* PRs show the developer is actively contributing to the project.
* A good proportion reflects quality over quantity (larger, well-documented contributions).



* **Ideal Metrics**:
  * Majority of PRs should be merged.
  * PRs should include comprehensive descriptions and follow coding standards.
  * Timely responses to feedback (e.g., within 1-2 business days).

***

### **2. Commits: \~25-35%**

* Indicates the frequency and granularity of contributions.
* Too many tiny commits may show inefficiency; too few massive ones may lack traceability.



* **Ideal Metrics**:
  * Commit messages should be meaningful and follow conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits).
  * A healthy commit history balances between feature implementation, bug fixes, and documentation updates.

***

### **3. Code Reviews: \~20-30%**

* Code reviews demonstrate collaborative and leadership qualities.
* Encourages knowledge sharing and improves code quality.



* **Ideal Metrics**:
  * Regularly review PRs submitted by teammates.
  * Provide constructive, actionable feedback.
  * Follow up to ensure the feedback is implemented.

***

### **4. Issues: \~10-20%**

* Reporting, managing, and resolving issues reflects problem-solving skills.
* Issues often drive the planning and tracking of work.



* **Ideal Metrics**:
  * Open issues that are clear, concise, and include steps to reproduce (if a bug).
  * Actively participate in discussions on existing issues.
  * Resolve and close a fair proportion of issues relative to your work.

## **Example Contribution Breakdown for a Developer**

| **Activity**  | **Contribution** |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Pull Requests | 30-40%           |
| Commits       | 25-35%           |
| Code Reviews  | 20-30%           |
| Issues        | 10-20%           |



## **Key Considerations**

1. **Project Role**: If you're a team lead, expect a higher percentage in code reviews. For developers focusing on implementation, pull requests and commits may dominate.
2. **Team Size**: Smaller teams require more diverse involvement in all activities. Larger teams allow specialization.
3. **Project Phase**: During early development, commits and PRs may be higher. In later stages, code reviews and issue tracking may increase.
